	<h1>Public Engagement</h1>
  <p>I've been actively involved in Public Engagement activities since my MSc. The activities I've taken part in are listed below.</p><br/>
	
<p>I'm going to take part in <a href="http://soapboxscience.org/">Soapbox Science</a> this summer in July! If you want to come chat,
		hopefully I'll be able to share more details soon. </p>
 
<p>The 'Neurococktails' event on the relationship between genes and drugs of abuse, led by <a href="https://www.psych.ox.ac.uk/team/elizabeth-tunbridge"
  >Professor Liz Tunbridge</a>. This includes encouraging participants to precipitate the DNA of a strawberry, using a pineapple juice and strong rum mix. 
  This event has taken place in many forums, such as the Science Museum Lates (in London), and the Curiosity Carnival (at the Pitt Rivers in Oxford).</p>
    
  <p>The Emotion Research Exhibition as part of the Oxfordshire Science Festival, led by <a href="https://www.psych.ox.ac.uk/team/susannah-murphy">Dr Susannah Murphy</a>. 
  This involved discussing and demonstrating emotion research and common paradigms at a 'stall' in the Town Hall.</p>
  
  <p>PubHD: In November 2017 I presented my DPhil research to a general audience in ten minutes, using no visual aids, in a pub. 
	  This was a great opportunity to discuss my research with those I wouldn't normally get to meet!</p>
