	<p>I'm a DPhil student in <a href="https://www.psych.ox.ac.uk/">Psychiatry</a> at the <a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/">University of Oxford</a>. I'm currently working on eating disorders and compulsivity. I'm doing some MRI work, some psychopharmacological work and also learning some computational psychiatry.
		My DPhil supervisors are <a href="https://www.psych.ox.ac.uk/team/phil-cowen">Professor Philip Cowen</a> and 
		<a href="https://www.psych.ox.ac.uk/team/rebecca-park">Professor Rebecca Park</a>. </p>
	<p>I have previously completed an MSc in Neuroscience and a BA in Psychology and Philosophy.</p>
