	<h1>Public Engagement</h1>
  <p>I've been actively involved in Public Engagement activities since my MSc. The activities I've taken part in are listed below.</p><br/>
	
<p><i>I took part in <a href="http://soapboxscience.org/">Soapbox Science</a> in July 2018! This was a great experience - standing on an actual soapbox for an hour, 
	talking about science and interacting with anyone who came by. </p>
 
<p>The 'Neurococktails' event on the relationship between genes and drugs of abuse, led by <a href="https://www.psych.ox.ac.uk/team/elizabeth-tunbridge"
  >Professor Liz Tunbridge</a>. This includes encouraging participants to precipitate the DNA of a strawberry, using a pineapple juice and strong rum mix. 
  This event has taken place in many forums, such as the Science Museum Lates (in London), and the Curiosity Carnival (at the Pitt Rivers in Oxford).</p>
    
  <p>The Emotion Research Exhibition as part of the Oxfordshire Science Festival, led by <a href="https://www.psych.ox.ac.uk/team/susannah-murphy">Dr Susannah Murphy</a>. 
  This involved discussing and demonstrating emotion research and common paradigms at a 'stall' in the Town Hall.</p>
  
  <p>PubHD: In November 2017 I presented my DPhil research to a general audience in ten minutes, using no visual aids, in a pub. 
	  This was a great opportunity to discuss my research with those I wouldn't normally get to meet!</p></i>
