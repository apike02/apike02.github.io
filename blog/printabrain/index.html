	<h1>3D printing a brain</h1>
  <img src="pics/brainprint/still_brain.jpg"> 
  <p>Recently, a lab member left and I was hit by a brilliant idea: how about a giving them their own 3D printed brain as a gift? Now, if anyone had had a better idea I think it would have been likely that we'd have abandoned ship, but nobody did, and so I had to make good on my offer: 3D printing a brain, in a pandemic, with no experience. This documents my efforts and the resources I found helpful. I've included some pictures of the process, but not of the final result, as brains are pretty unique and potentially identifiable!</p>
	
  <p>First of all, I found three sets of instructions that were incredibly helpful (these links open in new tabs): 
    <ul>
    <li><a href ="https://riojournal.com/articles.php?journal_name=rio&id=10398" target="_blank">This paper by Chris Madan</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.sculpteo.com/blog/2017/11/08/how-to-3d-print-your-own-brain-using-mri-or-ct-scans-free-software/" target="_blank">This blogplost on sculpteo</a></li> 
    <li><a href="https://www.instructables.com/3D-print-your-own-brain/" target="_blank">This blogpost on instructables</a></li></ul></p>
  
  <p>I would recommend using Chris Madan's instructions for most of it, except the tridecimator part. I preferred to play around in MeshLab directly.</p>

  <p>This is my summary of what to do (note that I printed using an Ultimaker, and also use Windows - these instructions will be most useful if you're doing the same):
    <ol>
      <li>You need the raw (i.e. unpreprocessed) scan of your target brain. You ideally want the files in .nii or .nii.gz (nifi) or .dcm (dicom) format. If you have two separate T1 files, the bigger one is almost certainly the one you want. If you have .dcm, you'll probably want to convert to nifti - there are instructions for that in the third link above. </li>
      <li>Install freesurfer (see note at the bottom for how I did this with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).  </li>
      <li>Run recon-all, which will extract brain tissue and segment the brain, and turn it into a mesh. It will also give you two hemispheres, which is handy to print later. The specific command I ran is:
        <samp>/mnt/c/Users/apike/freesurfer/7.1.1-1//bin/recon-all -s brain_directory -all -i /mnt/c/Users/apike/freesurfer/7.1.1-1//subjects/brain_directory/t1_1.nii </samp></li>
        </samp>
      <li>Then, chill out for a day or so. This process takes a while.</li>
      <li>You next need to convert rh.pial and lh.pial to files that MeshLab can open. You want to use MeshGeometry for this - download that <a href="https://github.com/r03ert0/meshgeometry" target="_blank">here</a>, by downloading the zip file and unzipping in a directory of your choice. I modified Chris Madan's script to do just this part, see below. </li>
      <li>Afterwards, you can open the rh.pial.ply and lh.pial.ply files and play around with them in MeshLab!</li>
      <li>I liked the results from quadratic edge decimation (via filters -> remeshing, simplification and reconstruction -> simplification: quadratic edge collapse decimation), followed by laplacian smoothing (via filters->smoothing->laplacian). For the 'target number of faces', I went down by a scale of around 10, from 285886 to 35000 for the right hemisphere, which ended up the kind of resolution I wanted. For the smoothing, I just used the defaults. </li>
      <li>Save your finished objects as .stl files (via 'export mesh as'). </li>
      <li>Install <a href="https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura">Ultimaker Cura</a> to finalise your design (unless someone is doing this part for you!).</li>
      <li>Optional: ensure the brain is the scale you want it. I printed using a scale of 50%, and the two hemispheres were each 40g or so. This was great for what I wanted, and I estimate you'll use a lot more plastic for a full-size brain.</li>
      <li>The default settings will do too much detail and density for most purposes. Edit them by clicking on the panel on the top right, which says something like 'fast - 0.2mm, 10%'. I set the layer weight to 0.2, infill density to 10% (though I've seen people saying even 2% or 5% is ok). The print temperature is material dependent but for PLA it's typically around 200 degrees.</li>
      <li>Rotate the brain so the surface you're least interested in is at the bottom (via the rotation menu snap rotation and selecting the surface). Add supports and a skirt - it will therefore print extra material, so that it doesn't just smear (turns out plastic can't print to thin air, so it needs to have some kind of structure if there are any eleemnts that are not flush to the printing platform). If you have two different materials, make the supports another colour so you can see them more easily and know which parts to remove. A note on this - the supports were apparently hard to remove using tweezers from the ventricles, so you might want to try avoiding this... or if not, you'll just have to sacrifice some pairs of tweezers.</li>
      <li>Any surfaces that show up as red are not flush to the platform, so you want to rotate it until the amount of red is minimised.</li>
      <li>Press the blue slice button, and then preview your design. You should see an estimate of how long it'll take at the bottom. I would also 'save to disk' just so you have the file correctly rotated and ready to go in case something goes wrong and you need to reprint. </li>
      <li>Ensure you're connected to your chosen printer, and have inserted the relevant plastic, and press print! You should check as it's starting - by the time it's a few hours in things should be ok, as most problems will happen early on (plastic not coming out, smearing, etc.)</li>
     </ol>

  <p>And this is a short clip of what it looks like actually printing!</p>

  <h2>Installing freesurfer</h2>
  <p>This is a huge pain if you have Windows. In the end, I followed <a href="https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FS7_wsl">these instructions</a>.
  You do, however, need to do something called 'screen forwarding', to allow freesurfer to actually open graphical interfaces within WSL.
  I found that you can do this by opening WSL (I used MobaXTerm to do this), and at the top it shows you what your display is set to. Then, type: 
  <samp>export DISPLAY=192.XX.XX.X:X.X.</samp> </p>
     
  <h2>Converting to .stl</h2>
  <samp>mg=/mnt/c/Users/apike/freesurfer/meshgeometry-master/meshgeometry_linux<br>

    cd $FREESURFER_HOME/subjects/vbrain/surf/<br>
    
    f=rh.pial<br>
    
    $mg -i $f -centre -o $f.ply<br>
     
    
    f=lh.pial<br>
    
    $mg -i $f -centre -o $f.ply<br>
 </samp>
  <h2>UCL-specific factors</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.instituteofmaking.org.uk/makespace/faqs">The Institute of Making</a> lets you print for free at the time of writing if you want to use less than 100g of plastic.</p>
  <p>I also think that the Institute of Making computers all have Ultimaker Cura installed already.</p>
