<div class="blurb">
	<p>Hi, I'm a DPhil student in <a href="https://www.psych.ox.ac.uk/">Psychiatry</a> at the <a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/">University of Oxford</a>. I'm currently working on eating disorders and compulsivity. I'm doing some MRI work, some psychopharmacological work and also learning some computational psychiatry.
My supervisors are Professor Philip Cowen and Professor Rebecca Park. </p>
